3 things you need to know about meal replacement shakes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Meal replacement shakes aren't what you think they are.**

Meal replacement shakes do contain ample amounts of protein and other nutrients your body needs, and they can help you lose some weight, when used right. That means you drink a nutrient-rich shake in replacement of one or two meals a day to help you cut your calorie intake. But they're not going to magically help you shed 50 pounds, they're not meant to be used to starve yourself and they're not protein shakes.

**2. Successful meal replacement diets require more than drinking shakes.**

You can't drink a shake, wait 10 minutes, step on the scale and expect to see that you've lost a couple pounds. If you really want to lose weight, you have to eat less and exercise more than you currently are. Meal replacement shakes help with the first part. It keeps you full longer so you don't get the munchies before your next meal.

**3. It's an easy, convenient diet to follow.**

Meal replacement shake diet is pretty easy to follow that doesn't require calorie counting at every meal or reading every label of everything you cook with. Just replace one or two of your meals a day with a meal replacement shake, most choose breakfast or lunch, and then eat a healthy mid-afternoon snack and a balanced dinner.
